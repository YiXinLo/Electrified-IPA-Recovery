## 📄 Overview

This research investigates the energy-saving and carbon-reduction potential of electrification technologies—namely electric boilers (EB), heat pump-assisted distillation (HPAD), and steam-generating heat pumps (SGHP)—applied to the recovery of electronic-grade isopropanol (IPA).

Scope of the study includes:
- Azeotropic and extractive distillation simulations (via Aspen Plus V12.1)
- Energy cost and CO₂ emission factor estimations
- Comparative analysis of SGHP and HPAD systems
- Evaluation based on Taiwan’s 2023–2024 energy market
